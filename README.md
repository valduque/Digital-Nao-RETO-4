# Tattler Revamp Project

##  Overview
Tattler is a Mexican app that lists restaurants all over the country.  
Recently, user traffic dropped a lot, so the goal of this project is to **bring it back to life** with a more modern and personalized version.

The story starts with **Alejandra**, a project manager, and **Elian**, a developer.  
They team up to make Tattler smarter â€” an app that gives **personalized restaurant recommendations**, lets users **add comments and ratings**, and always stays up to date.
